# Configuration Conventions

File names must match domains + '.conf' 

Write here parts of nginx config that go to server {} block.

No need to specify listen 443 

HTTP 1.1 TLS, HTTP2 and HTTP3 are supported

Related HTTP endpoint with redirects is configured automatically.


# To enable HTTP3 
write

```
# nginx-auto-acme-quic
``` 

# To enable HSTS preload 

```
# nginx-auto-acme-sts-preload
```

## Non-server blocks 

If you need to define upstream or something else outside of server blocks, put it to file \_nginx-http.conf in this directory.


## TLS 1.0 and 1.1 
If you need support for older versions of TLS (for MSIE 9 or old Java) â€” just create empty 'tls1_0.legacy' in this directory.
